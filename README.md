# Example Sound Laws Accompanying the Paper "Modeling Sound Change with Ordered Layers of Simultaneous Sound Laws"

The following example files can be used in the [MISOL](https://misol.edictor.org) directly in two ways: One can download the file and *import* it through MISOL's import/export tab. Alternatively, one can just copy-paste the relevant sound laws from the text-files into the system itself (here, one has to check where to paste them, following also the instructions in the Help tab in the application.
